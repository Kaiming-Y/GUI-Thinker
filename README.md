<!-- ## ‚ú® What's new in GUI-Thinker? -->

**GUI-Thinker** is a newly developed GUI agent based on a self-reflection mechanism. We systematically investigate GUI automation and establish the following workflow, incorporating three key self-reflection modules:

- Planner-Critic (Post-Planning Critique): Self-corrects the initial plans to ensure their accuracy

- Step-Check (Pre-Execution Validation): Remove redundant steps or modify them if necessary.

- Actor-Critic (Post-Action Evaluation): Review the task completion status and apply necessary corrections.

## ‚ú®Key Features

- üèÜ **High Performance**: Our GUI-Thinker surpasses Cluade-3.5 Computer Use by 14.9% on our WorldGUI Benchmark.
- üåê **Universal LMM Support**: Seamlessly integrates with **A Wide Range** of LMMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- üîÄ **Flexible Interaction**: Supports both **intructional video input** and **non-instructional video input**.
- üöÄ **Easy Deployment**:  Get started instantly with a simple `.\shells\start_server.bat` command and `python test_guithinker_custom.py` without the need of Docker or Virtual Machine.

## üì¢ Update

* [2025.03.08] We made a demo for showing the GUI-Thinker.
* [2025.03.05] ‚ö° Our GUI-Thinker now supports both [instructional video](https://github.com/showlab/WorldGUI/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-test-with-a-prepared-demo-case-under-the-folder-data) and [non-video](https://github.com/showlab/WorldGUI/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-test-with-your-own-user-query) inputs. Enjoy!
* [2025.03.05] üòä We release the code of GUI-Thinker. Now, we support running our GUI agent on your Windows computer locally [Getting started](https://github.com/showlab/WorldGUI/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started-with-computer-use-agent-gui-thinker). GUI-Thinker now supports various base LMMs through API calling, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Local model support will be available soon.

* [2025.02.13] We release the WorldGUI in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08047).

## ü§ñ Core Components:
Our codebases includes:

- [x] **GUI Parser:** Utilizes Google OCR and PyAutoGUI to extract element grounding information.
- [x] **State-Aware Planner:** Accepts screenshots and instructional videos to generate plans.
- [x] **Planner-Critic:** Refines the initial plan generated by the planner.
- [x] **Step-Check:** Verifies task completion and redundancy using various output statuses (e.g., `<Modify>`, `<Pass>`, `<Continue>`, `<Finished>`). It also implements an LLM-driven region search module to locate target elements.
- [x] **Actor:** Translates action descriptions into executable code (e.g., `click(100, 200)`).
- [x] **Actor-Critic:** Checks task completion status by comparing before and after screenshots and uses an iterative action correction algorithm to gradually verify and correct actions.
- [x] **Input with Instructional Video:** Supports the execution with instructional video.
- [x] **Input without Instructional Video:** Supports the direct execution with user query.
- [x] **Frontend-backend communication system:** Supports seperate the frontend and backend for flexible deploying the locally running model and user interfaces.


See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08047) for detail. Our GUI-Thinker is along with a newly curted Desktop GUI benchmark WorldGUI.

## ‚úÖ Todo List

GUI-Thinker is continuously evolving! Here's what's coming:

- üñ•Ô∏è **Lightweight Version**: Supporting a lightweight version specially design for Claude-3.5-Sonnet Computer Use without the GUI parser.

- üëì **OOTB Usage**: Supporting a user-frendly interface based on Gradio.

- üìä **Locally-running Models**: Supporting the ShowUI or UI-TARS as the Actor in our framework.

- üé® **Huggingface Demo**: Developing online demo in Huggingface.
